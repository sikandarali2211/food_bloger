                            <p>Oranges are a type of low calorie, highly nutritious citrus fruit. As part of a healthful
                                and varied diet, oranges contribute to strong, clear skin and can help lower a person’s
                                risk of many conditions.
                                <br>
                                Oranges are popular due to their natural sweetness, the many different types available,
                                and the diversity of uses. For example, a person can consume them in juices and
                                marmalades, eat them whole, or use zested peel to add a tangy flavor to cakes and
                                desserts.
                                <br>
                                This popular citrus fruit is particularly known for its vitamin C content. However,
                                oranges contain a range of other plant compounds and antioxidants that may reduce
                                inflammation and work against disease.
                                <br>
                                In this article, we look at the many health benefits of oranges, their nutritional
                                profile, and how to include more in the diet.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Benefits </h2>
                            <p>The nutrients in oranges offer a range of health benefits. The sections below discuss
                                these benefits in more detail. <br>
                            <h2>Cancer</h2>
                            As an excellent Source of the antioxidant vitamin C, oranges may help combat the formation
                            of free radicals that cause cancer.
                            <br>
                            Although an adequate vitamin C intake is necessary and very beneficial, the amount a person
                            would need for the desired therapeutic effect on cancer is more than they could
                            realistically consume.
                            <br>
                            For example, one study concluded that medical scientists could harness the power of vitamin
                            C from oranges to inhibit colorectal cancer cells in the future. However, the authors
                            concede that 300 oranges’ worth of vitamin C would be necessary.
                            <br>
                            That said, in 2015, a study linked grapefruit and orange juice with a higher risk of skin
                            cancer. Researchers found that people who consumed high amounts of whole grapefruit or
                            orange juice were over a third more likely to develop melanoma than those who consumed low
                            amounts. This may have been due to citrus compounds that exert photocarcinogen properties.
                            <br>
                            More research is necessary to confirm the effects of orange consumption on cancer risk.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h2>Blood pressure</h2>
                            Oranges contain no sodium, which helps keep a person below their daily limitTrusted Source.
                            On the other hand, a cup of orange juice can boost daily potassium intakeTrusted Source by
                            14%.
                            <br>
                            Maintaining a low sodium intake is essential to lowering blood pressure. However, increasing
                            potassium intake may be just as important for reducing a person’s risk of high blood
                            pressure, as it can help support the relaxation and opening of blood vessels.
                            <br>
                            According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS), increasing potassium intake can reduce
                            the riskTrusted Source of high blood pressure and stroke.
                            <br>
                            <h2>Heart health</h2>
                            Oranges are a good source of fiber and potassium, both of which can support heart health.
                            <br>
                            According to one 2017 reviewTrusted Source of previous meta-analyses, consuming enough fiber
                            can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease both developing and being fatal. The
                            review links this effect to its ability to lower cholesterol levels in the blood.
                            <br>
                            One cup of orange juice can provide 14%Trusted Source of a person’s daily potassium
                            requirement.
                            <br>
                            The ODS found that people with higher potassium intakes may have a lower risk of stroke and
                            other cardiovascular diseases. They mainly attribute this to the effects of potassium on
                            blood pressure.
                            <br>
                            <h2>Diabetes</h2>
                            A medium orange weighing 131 grams (g) contributes 3.14 gTrusted Source of fiber, which is
                            nearly 10% of an adult’s daily fiber requirement. Several studies have found that fiber can
                            improve some factorsTrusted Source that contribute to diabetes development and progression.
                            <br>
                            For example, one 2019 studyTrusted Source found that consuming 4 g of a dietary fiber
                            supplement per day did not reduce blood glucose but improved how the body responds to
                            insulin. Low insulin sensitivity can contribute to type 2 diabetes.
                            <br>
                            Weight control is also important for reducing the risk of diabetes, as obesity and
                            overweight can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. The body processes fiber
                            more slowlyTrusted Source than other nutrients, so it can help a person feel fuller for
                            longer and reduce their urge to eat snacks throughout the day.
                            <br>
                            Following a diet that contains a high proportion of fruits and vegetables can support blood
                            sugar control and reduce the riskTrusted Source of type 2 diabetes and disease progression.
                            That said, a diabetes friendly diet should include healthful foods from a variety of food
                            groups.
                            <br>
                            <h2>Skin</h2>
                            Consuming enough vitamin C can help a person maintain skin healthTrusted Source and
                            appearance.
                            <br>
                            Vitamin C contributes to collagen productionTrusted Source. Collagen supports the skin,
                            promotes wound healing, and improves skin strength.
                            <br>
                            The outcome of a 2015 reviewTrusted Source suggests that dietary vitamin C improved how
                            people perceived their skin health and how healthful it actually was, including appearance,
                            wrinkling, elasticity, and roughness.
                            <br>
                            <h2>Diet</h2>
                            It is best to pick oranges at the peak of their ripeness. Unlike some other fruits, they do
                            not ripen or improve in quality after picking. <br> People should store oranges at room
                            temperature and away from direct sunlight. <br>
                            <br>It can be hard to find ripe fruits and vegetables in the winter. However, this is the
                            perfect time to buy citrus fruits. <br> Winter is the peak season for oranges and other
                            citruses. <br>
                            There are several different types of orange available, including: <br>
                            1. navel<br>
                            2. mandarin<br>

                            4. blood oranges<br>
                            5. Valencia<br>
                            6. Seville<br>
                            7. Jaffa<br>
                            Here are some tips for using orange in the diet: <br>
                            1. Keep a bowl on the kitchen table or counter stocked with fresh fruit from the season.
                            Seeing fruits readily available will likely influence people to choose them as a snack,
                            rather than raiding the cupboards for a less healthful option. <br>
                            2. Make a fruit salad using strawberries, pineapple, mandarin oranges, and grapes. <br>
                            3. Add some orange slices to a salad at lunch or dinner. Complement the oranges with walnuts
                            or pecans, a crumbled cheese, and a light balsamic or citrus vinaigrette dressing. <br>
                            4. Make homemade juice. Freshly squeezed orange juice can be a flavourful, refreshing, and
                            nutritious addition to a person’s morning routine. <br> Squeezing orange juice at home will
                            mean that there are no added preservatives or sweeteners. <br>
